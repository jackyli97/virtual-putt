# Wireframe

This game will consist of a single screen with multiple screens for each hole/round, game controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn, and the scorecard modal. Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as sliders to control the aim and force of a hit. The main body of the screen will be sections of the golf course with the target hole and different obstacles.
